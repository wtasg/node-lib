# Development Checklist

## Constraints

- [ ] Do not delete failing tests. Explain first. Ask second. No delete.
- [ ] Do not turn off eslint warnings to avoid linting errors.

## Code Quality Guidelines

### Structure & Style

- [ ] Imports/Exports: Imports at the top, exports at the bottom.
- [ ] Visibility: All primary functions should be exported.
- [ ] Mutability: Prefer `const` over `let` (`prefer-const`).
- [ ] Control Blocks: Always use braces `{}` for `if`, `for`, etc. (`curly`).
- [ ] AI Agent Protocol: AI agents MUST honor the project's ESLint and EditorConfig settings for all modifications. Run `npm run lint` to verify compliance.

### Documentation & Examples

- [ ] JSDoc: Comprehensive JSDoc for all exported functions and types.
- [ ] Examples:
  - At least 3 success examples showing different use cases.
  - At least 1 error/fallback example showing edge cases.

### Consistency

- [ ] Default States: For complex types, provide a factory/function that returns default values.
- [ ] Cross-Lang Parity: Match default values with Golang zero-value conventions where applicable.

## Pre-flight Checklist

- [ ] Linting: Code passes npm run lint without warnings.
- [ ] Testing:
  - [ ] Unit tests written for all new functionality.
  - [ ] All tests pass: npm run test.
- [ ] Build: Project builds successfully: npm run build.
- [ ] Documentation:
  - [ ] readme.txt updated with new features/changes.
  - [ ] Generated docs refreshed: npm run docs && npm run docs:json.
- [ ] Version Control:
  - [ ] changelog.txt updated for the current version.
  - [ ] Identity verified (git log -n1) to protect PII.
